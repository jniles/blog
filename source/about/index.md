# About

Hello!  This is my blog for scribbling random thoughts about the world that I'll hopefully look at later and will be of some use to me.  Perhaps it will be of use to you as well.

I work for [IMA World Health](https://imaworldhealth.org) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo writing software and designing and implementing various development projects.  Most of my time is spent writing code for [BHIMA](https://bhi.ma), our attempt to build culturally appropriate tools for managing hospitals.  I'll write about our approaches frequently on this blog.

These thoughts are my own and do not reflect the opinion of my employer.  Or even, perhaps, my future self.
